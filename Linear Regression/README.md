## Project Overview:
* Created a model that predicts the score (in terms of range) of IPL matches
* Optimized Multiple-Linear, Decision Tree, Random Forest.

## How will this project help?
* This project is for the fantasy cricket fans out there, helping them to earn extra fantasy points for Dream11 IPL 

## Resources Used:
* Packages: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn
* Dataset by Shivam Mitra: https://github.com/codophobia/CricketScorePredictor

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
* Removing unwanted columns
* Keeping only consistent teams
* Removing the first 5 overs data in every match
* Converting the column 'date' from string into datetime object
* Handling categorical features

## Model Building and Evaluation:
Evaluation metric: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
* Multiple Linear Regression - 15.84
* Decision Tree - 22.90
* Random Forest - 18.18

## Model Prediction:
